# Dataset-Scale-Impact-on-Heart-Disease-Model-Performance-RF-vs-LR
Two-phase ML study on heart disease classification. Initial analysis on 303-patient dataset showed no significant model differences. Expanded to 70,000+ records where Random Forest demonstrated statistically superior performance (F1: 0.721 vs 0.708) with comprehensive hyperparameter optimization and overfitting mitigation.
